# Terms of Service — Whispernator (Personal DM Translator Bot)

_Last updated: 2025-09-09_

These Terms govern your use of Whispernator, a personal translator for Discord messages.

## 1) Acceptance
By using Whispernator, you agree to these Terms and to Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

## 2) Service Description
Whispernator translates message text on Discord via **message context menu** commands. It is intentionally minimal:
- DM-focused (User-Install; **PrivateChannel** and **BotDM** contexts)
- No databases, queues, or server admin features
- Uses **Google Cloud Translation API (v3)**

## 3) Privacy
Our data handling is described in **PRIVACY.md**. By using the bot you consent to that processing.

## 4) Visibility & Ephemeral Replies
- The bot uses **ephemeral interaction replies**, which are shown **only to the invoking user** in the same chat (1:1 DM, Group DM).
- Ephemeral messages are part of Discord’s interaction system. They are not visible to other participants in the DM/GDM.

## 5) Language Support
The bot exposes only languages supported by **Google Cloud Translation v3**.  
Examples: `en, es, pt, fr, de, it, nl, pl, ru, tr, ja, ko, zh, zh-TW, no, da, fi, sv, cs, el, hu, ro, uk, ar, he`.  
**Nynorsk (`nn`)** is not supported and is therefore not shown. Norwegian locales are normalized to **`no`**.

## 6) Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Violate laws or rights of others, or submit content that is illegal, infringing, or abusive.
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, overload, or disrupt the service.
- Submit sensitive personal information unless you understand the risks of sharing such content with translation services.

## 7) Third-Party Services
Whispernator relies on **Discord** (interactions) and **Google Cloud Translation API (v3)** (translations). We do not control and are not responsible for third-party terms, policies, or uptime.

## 8) Availability & Changes
The service is provided on an “as available” basis. We may update, suspend, or discontinue features at any time (e.g., API changes, rate limits, maintenance).

## 9) Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TRANSLATIONS MAY BE INACCURATE OR MISLEADING; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 10) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED **USD $50**.

## 11) Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from your content, your use of the service, or your breach of these Terms.

## 12) Ownership
We (or our licensors) retain all rights, title, and interest in the service, trademarks, and code not otherwise covered by open-source licenses. You retain rights in your own content.

## 13) Termination
You may stop using the service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for any reason, including suspected abuse, security issues, or violations of these Terms.

## 14) Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of **[Your Country/Region]** without regard to conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction and venue will be in the courts of **[Your City/Region]**. (Replace the brackets with your chosen jurisdiction.)

## 15) Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms. Material changes will be noted in the repository changelog. Your continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
