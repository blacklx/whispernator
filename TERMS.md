# Terms of Service — Whispernator (Personal DM Translator Bot)

_Last updated: 2025-09-08_

These Terms govern your use of Whispernator, a personal translator for Discord messages.

## 1) Acceptance
By using Whispernator, you agree to these Terms and to Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

## 2) Service Description
Whispernator provides message translations on Discord via context menu commands. It is intentionally minimal:
- No databases or accounts
- No server-linking or admin features
- Uses Google Cloud Translation API (v3)

## 3) Privacy
Our handling of data is described in the **Privacy Policy** (PRIVACY.md). By using the bot you consent to the processing described there.

## 4) Ephemeral Replies & Visibility
- In servers and group DMs, the bot uses **ephemeral interaction replies** so only the invoking user sees the translation.
- In **1:1 DMs**, Discord does **not** support ephemeral replies. By default, Whispernator **does not post** translations in 1:1 DMs to avoid exposing the text to the other participant.

## 5) Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Violate laws or rights of others, or submit content that is illegal, defamatory, infringing, or abusive.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, overload, or disrupt the service.
- Submit sensitive personal information (e.g., health, financial, government IDs) unless you understand the risks of sharing such content with translation services.

## 6) Third-Party Services
Whispernator relies on **Discord** (for interactions) and **Google Cloud Translation API (v3)** (to translate text). We do not control and are not responsible for third-party terms, policies, or uptime.

## 7) Availability & Changes
The bot is provided on an “as available” basis. We may update, suspend, or discontinue features at any time (for example, due to API changes, rate limits, or maintenance).

## 8) Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TRANSLATIONS MAY BE INCORRECT OR MISLEADING; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 9) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED **USD $50**.

## 10) Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from your content, your use of the service, or your breach of these Terms.

## 11) Ownership
We (or our licensors) retain all rights, title, and interest in the service, trademarks, and code not otherwise covered by open-source licenses. You retain rights in your own content.

## 12) Termination
You may stop using the service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for any reason, including suspected abuse, security issues, or violations of these Terms.

## 13) Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of **[Your Country/Region]** without regard to conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction and venue will be in the courts of **[Your City/Region]**. (Replace these brackets with your chosen jurisdiction.)

## 14) Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms. Material changes will be noted in the repository changelog. Your continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
